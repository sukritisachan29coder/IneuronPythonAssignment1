    "Q1-Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-: Python is called a general purpose and high level language as its is highly readable and is almost very close to english language, which means its syntax is quite easy to understand, we can do a bunch of tasks with writing minimal syntax as compared to languages like C++ or JAVA.\n",
    "For ex: If I have to print “Hello World!” in Python, I can simply write\n",
    "\n",
    "print(“Hello World!”)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very easy to understand even for someone who is not from coding background and we had to write very minimal syntax as compared to above mentioned languages.\n"

    "Q2:Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Python is referred to as dynamically typed language as the compiler itself understands the datatype of a variable for ex: if we are writing a=5, the Python compiler is itself able to make it out that this is an integer type variable.\n",
    "Also we cannot do incompatible types operations in Python for ex: If we are doing \n",
    "print(“I have ”+3+”mangoes”)\n",
    "it will give me an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will give an error saying that these 2 data types are not compatible with each other,though we did not define the datatype, but Python compiler is intelligent enough to figure out the difference between the datatypes.\n"

    "A: Python being a dynamically typed language is extremely easy to understand and we need to write minimal syntax for executing our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "B: In Python while declaring variables, we don’t need to give data type,Python is intelligent enough to understand as to what data type the user wants to give.\n",
    "\n",
    "C: Python has some great library support, which not all languages offer.Library is basically a code which is being written by someone else and we as Python users can just import the library into our program by a simple import statement which makes our work easy and smoother.Some examples of libraries are : Pandas,Numpy,TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "D: Python is portable language, it follows WORA(Write Once run Anywhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Python is a bit slow as compared to other languages such as JAVA, as the code in Python is being interpreted at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "B: Python’s memory consumption is quite high as compared to other programming languages.\n"
